## Key Differences from shadcn/ui

This project enhances the original shadcn/ui with several improvements:

- **Separate `variant` and `tint` properties**: Unlike shadcn/ui which only has `variant` (which can be misleading), we provide clear separation between component variants (structural/behavioral changes) and tints (color variations)
- **Automatic dark mode colors**: No need to manually define `dark:` classes for most use cases - dark colors are automatically generated via OKLCH variables
